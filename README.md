## Generator Tool

This is a tool to interface with Spellman HV generators over TCP/IP and serial ports.
It is able to change their setpoints, monitor voltage i.e.
It was made by using the official documentation of their respective devices and a bit of reverse engineering.

The native Spellman software was outdated and did not receive any updates / had a lot of bugs and issues so we made our own.

## Procedural Planets 

This is a project of mine playing around with some procedural mesh generation and shading in THREE.js.
It was inspired by the work of Sebastian Lague.
He made a video series about procedural planets in unity, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN39W020LqU&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
